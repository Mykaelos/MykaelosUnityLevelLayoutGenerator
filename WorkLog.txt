1h - Dug around for which version of the LevelLayoutGenerator was the latest and did Yield correctly. Turns out it was Dungeon World, which I had totally forgot about.
1h - Added a button to toggle Yield so I can switch between instant generation and yielded generation.
1h - Copied code over to its own git project, so I can stop copypasta-ing it everywhere.
